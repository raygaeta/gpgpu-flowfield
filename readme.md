# Particle Flow with GPGPU 🌬️✨

#### This project explores the power of GPU computing to create a stunning particle animation influenced by dynamic flow fields. By combining General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) and flow field techniques, particles move fluidly as if guided by invisible streams, delivering an immersive and mesmerizing visual experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🌊 Dynamic Flow Field Simulation  
#### Particles are influenced by dynamically calculated flow fields, simulating motion as if propelled by invisible streams.

### ⚡ GPGPU Efficiency  
#### Utilizes GPGPU to perform intensive calculations directly on the GPU, ensuring high performance and smooth real-time rendering.

### 🎨 Model-Based Particle Initialization  
#### Particles are initialized based on the position and color attributes of a 3D model, adding structure and complexity to the animation.
